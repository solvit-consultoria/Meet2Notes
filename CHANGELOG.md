# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.6.1 - 2026-09-10

- Added simultaneous microphone and system-audio capture so video calls can
  record both sides of the conversation into one private local meeting.
- Added a clock-aligned 48 kHz mono mixer with per-input resampling, equal-gain
  headroom, gap preservation, and the same mixed frames for live transcription
  and the final WAV recording.
- Redesigned the New transcription source picker with independent microphone
  and system selections, persistent device choices, platform guidance, source
  availability checks, and separate live level meters.
- Preserved the single-source capture API while adding a bounded `source_ids`
  request for exactly one microphone/interface plus one system source.
- Improved capture failure handling for disconnected devices, silent Windows
  loopback outputs, pause/resume, partial stream startup, and cleanup on retry.
- Added cross-platform combined-capture and mixer tests plus detailed Windows,
  macOS, and Linux setup and troubleshooting documentation.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-08-24

- Added a local read-only MCP server for Claude Desktop, ChatGPT Desktop,
  Codex, and compatible `stdio` clients, turning the private meeting archive
  into a directly queryable AI knowledge source.
- Added bounded MCP tools for meeting discovery, metadata, transcript pages,
  completed AI notes, exact FTS5 keyword search, and existing hybrid RAG
  evidence with meeting, speaker, timestamp, and source provenance.
- Added generated Claude Desktop JSON and Codex/ChatGPT Desktop TOML
  configuration in Settings, an explicit MCP access switch, local endpoint
  discovery, loopback enforcement, and a read-only security boundary.
- Added the post-meeting Meeting Assistant with meeting/all-history scope,
  hybrid dense and BM25 retrieval, raw transcript and AI-note attachments,
  context budgeting, and the dedicated assistant avatar.
- Added the configurable Live AI Assistant behavior modes, priority direct
  questions, deterministic question/trigger detection, conversation context,
  and the redesigned movable, resizable, and minimizable widget.
- Added safe stable updates from official GitHub Releases, including user
  confirmation, SQLite backups, migration dry-runs, clean fast-forward checks,
  dependency validation, rollback, and preservation of existing settings and
  data directories.
- Added compact rebuild, copy, Markdown edit, and save controls to meeting AI
  Notes, including Note Format selection, version preservation, manual-edit
  provenance, and navigation protection for unsaved changes.
- Added automatic hierarchical AI notes for transcripts that exceed the model
  context, including block estimation, grounded evidence extraction, recursive
  consolidation, and a final Note Format pass.
- Added confirmation, persistent background progress, and per-meeting logging
  when rebuilding the historical RAG index.
- Defined the independent community-plugin workflow, added a public JSON
  listing and issue template, and coordinated the user, contributor, developer,
  and roadmap documentation around that single flow.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-08-13

- Replaced implicit final post-processing callbacks with an observable pipeline
  for final ASR, diarization, saved-voice matching, filters, and AI analysis.
- Added Plugin API v1 with typed artifacts, actions, filters, deterministic
  priorities, timeouts, failure policies, and Python entry-point discovery.
- Added a lazy shared provider registry for plugin transcription, diarization,
  summary, and embedding engines, model-only extensions, scoped directories,
  declarative settings, and hot registry refresh.
- Added composite transcription results with speaker turns so end-to-end models
  can bypass the separate diarization stage safely.
- Added local plugin management in Settings and a privacy-preserving execution
  ledger containing timings, statuses, and content digests.
- Added a built-in analysis-cleanup filter, a community plugin example, and
  contribution and roadmap documentation.
- Kept the existing Live transcription path and settings unchanged.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-26

- Renamed the application and all public entry points to Meet2Notes.
- Added one-command Windows, macOS, and Linux installation with platform-aware
  llama.cpp acceleration and safe CPU fallback.
- Added `meet2notes-models` for automatic download and verification of Faster
  Whisper, sherpa-onnx, and LFM2.5 models.
- Preserved existing LocalMeet2Resume data directories to avoid breaking stored
  recording paths during the rename.
- Rebuilt the README as a product-quality installation, privacy, architecture,
  and platform guide.
- Added a resident sherpa-onnx speaker-diarization worker with model management,
  configurable clustering, and transcript speaker assignment.
- Added a resident llama.cpp summary worker and the official LFM2.5 1.2B
  Q4_K_M managed preset.
- Added independent install, load, unload, status, memory, runtime, and
  generation controls to Settings.
- Added cancellable diarization and summary jobs plus summary persistence.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-25

- Rebuilt the transcription workspace as a single minimal editor.
- Added editable, persistent transcription names with automatic numbering.
- Added native audio-source discovery and live capture controls.
- Added Windows WASAPI loopback through PyAudioWPatch.
- Added portable PortAudio adapters for CoreAudio and PipeWire/Pulse/ALSA inputs.
- Added pause, resume, stop, level metering, and automatic final-quality refinement.
- Added true real-time transcription with overlapping low-latency audio windows.
- Added provisional live segments and an automatic full-quality refinement after Stop.
- Added an extensible transcription-engine settings card with runtime-aware device
  and compute-type choices, 100 Whisper languages, decoding controls, and live
  chunk/overlap tuning.
- Isolated Faster Whisper in a dedicated executor and kept the configured model
  resident in memory between transcriptions by default.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-25

- Added FFmpeg audio normalization for transcription.
- Added an optional, lazy Faster Whisper adapter with CPU `int8` and CUDA `float16`.
- Added fast, balanced, accurate, and very accurate model profiles.
- Added explicit confirmation before any Whisper model download.
- Added persistent transcription versions and progressive timestamped segments.
- Added segment editing, activation, find and replace, and retranscription.
- Added secure local media playback and a responsive transcript editor.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-24

- Added the FastAPI application and local responsive web interface.
- Added versioned SQLite migrations and repositories.
- Added safe media storage, FFmpeg capability detection, and media probing.
- Added a persistent asynchronous job queue with progress and cancellation.
- Added meeting, recording, settings, job, capability, and event APIs.
- Added automated tests and cross-platform continuous integration.
